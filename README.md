# CS50 Final Project
## Austin Bike Ride Planner

#### Video Demo: https://youtu.be/UJE7-VTVdXE

#### Description:
This is a web page to help you plan your next bike ride in Austin! Check the weather, suggested bike tire pressure, nutrition recommendations, and more.

#### Features:
- Bike tire PSI calculator (JS: psi.js). The user inputs relevant data and gets the suggested PSI to inflate their bike tires.
- Nutrition calcultor (JS: carbs.js). The user input their weight and gets the suggest nutrition per hour for a ride.
- Personal Strava widget. Shows my recent rides.
- Cycling checklist. Helps the user to not forget anything important you will need on your ride.
- Random Kanye quote generator. Created using a tutorial to help me learn how to use an API and get my JS to talk to my HTML (https://www.itzami.com/blog/build-a-quote-generator-with-javascript-your-first-api-project). Decided to keep it on the page for fun.
- CSS framework is Bootstrap
- Weather widget courtesy of weatherwidget.io

#### TO-DO
- Streamline psi.js code. There should be a less verbose way of calculating the suggested PSI.
-Implement an "Events" feature to create group ride information, including a ride sign-up, route sharing, and comments.
